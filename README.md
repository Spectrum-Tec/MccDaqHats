# MccDaqHats

See READ.Me in the daqhatscreate folder for more information on 
what is complete and what needs to be done.

The examples folder contains useful Julia examples.
the examplesTranslated172 is a tranlation of the C examples into 
Julia.  This is good for getting your feet wet, but not too useful.
