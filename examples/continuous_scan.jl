Example for continuous scan
MCC 172 Functions Demonstrated:
    mcc172_iepe_config_write
    mcc172_a_in_clock_config_write
    mcc172_a_in_clock_config_read

    mcc172_a_in_scan_stop
    mcc172_a_in_scan_cleanup

Purpose:
    Performa a continuous acquisition on 1 or more channels.

Description:
    Continuously acquires blocks of analog input data for a
    user-specified group of channels until the acquisition is
    stopped by the user.  The RMS voltage for each channel
    is displayed for each block of data received from the device.
